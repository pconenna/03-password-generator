## Password generator

# Description
This is a password generator. The users presses a button and answers questions to determine the structure of the password. The generator will then return them a randomly generated password based on the user's parameters.
# Installation
N/A
# Usage
When the user opens the page they see with the empty text area and the generate password button. When they press the button a series of alert boxes appear. The first one will ask for a number of characters and will not allow the user to progress if they enter invalid input. If they enter valid input they will then see alert boxes asking them if they want to use lowercase letters, uppercase letter, numbers, and special characters. Every choice they agree to will be noted by the program. If the users says no to every possible choce the alerts will replay the whole cycle. The user must select at least one parameter. After the user makes their selections the program will generate a password and return it in the text area.

I used the mini project from the JS unit as a reference to make sure I was using alerts and prompts correctly.
